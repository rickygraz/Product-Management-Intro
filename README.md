# Product-Management-Intro

# What is a Product Manager?
A Product manager is an individual that takes ownership of one or more products/components of a company. Many people refer to product managers as mini CEO's because they play a similar role in owning and taking responsibility for products.

# What it's like to be a Product Manager.
There are many different hats you can wear as a product manager and there are many different style of product management depending on where you are working, but in a general sense product management consists of understanding the product that you are the owner of from a wholistic view and improving on the features and functionality of it or potentially creating something from scratch.
