# What is a Product Manager?
A Product manager is an individual that takes ownership of one or more products/components of a company. Many people refer to product managers as mini CEO's because they play a similar role in owning and taking responsibility for products.

# What it's like to be a Product Manager.
There are many different hats you can wear as a product manager and there are many different style of product management depending on where you are working. In a general sense product management consists of understanding the product that you are the owner of from a wholistic view, and improving on the features and functionality of it. You may also be creating a new product from scratch. Other types of product management may be supporting one aspect of a larger component within a business. For instance, at Google there are multiple product managers for Google Cloud. Google Cloud is one product, but there may be a more senior individual that is the product lead who is supported by many Lead Product Manager that have more Product Managers supporting them.
